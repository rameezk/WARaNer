WARaNer
=======
WhatsApp Remote and Notifier.

**Disclaimer:** This is still in pre-pre-pre-alpha. There's bound to be broken stuff. In fact, there's probably nothing even here yet.

What is this?
-------------
WARaNer allows you to control WhatsApp from your PC/MAC/Laptop/TimeMachine. It can send and recieve messages.

Why?
----
Because I'm lazy, and I hate taking my phone out of my pocket.

What do I need?
---------------
*    A rooted android phone
*    Tasker
*    AutoRemote
*    AutoNotification
